# Twitch Defense
This Tower Defense prototype is designed for Twitch streaming, offering viewers an interactive experience through chat commands. In the lobby state, before the game starts, viewers can vote for a map and initiate a countdown using commands like !map1. Once the map is chosen and the game begins, players can spawn characters with specific classes (!sharpshooter, !demolition, !scientist, !soldier), command them to move to different locations (!1, !2, etc.), and interact with a limited shop (!shop command works, but shop is not useful for anything yet, only changes the weapon that is available.)
Before each wave, red skull indicators signal the impending monsters arrival, helping players anticipate the threat from specific streets or special spawn points (portals). This allows players to strategically position their characters. The game progressively intensifies with increasing amount of monster, spawn points , boss waves(starts, but the boss itself is broken.)
Monsters initially target simple buildings and, once destroyed, shift their focus to the main HQ/rescue building. Viewer characters are placed in limited-space locations, with a drawn line connecting their nickname to their character, ensuring everyone knows their location.
